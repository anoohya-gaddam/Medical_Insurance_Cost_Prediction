# Medical_Insurance_Cost_Prediction

Project Overview:
This project develops an automatic system for predicting medical insurance costs based on personal data. The model can help insurance companies estimate the costs associated with new and existing customers, facilitating more accurate budgeting and pricing strategies.

Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to predict the medical insurance costs of individuals based on their demographic and health metrics. This predictive model can assist insurance companies in making data-driven decisions regarding policy pricing.

Data Analysis:
An initial analysis of the dataset provides insights into the correlations between various features and the target variable (insurance costs). The analysis involves statistical summaries and visualizations to understand the data distribution and relationships.

Data Pre-Processing:
Prepare the data for modeling. It includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and any additional data transformations required to optimize model performance.

Model Training:
Employed multiple regression models to accurately predict medical insurance costs using various demographic and health-related features. Linear Regression model Served as our baseline model and Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble model has improved accuracy and handled non-linear data better.

Model Evaluation
Model performance was assessed using key metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the square root of the average squared differences between prediction and actual observation.
R-squared (Coefficient of Determination): Provides an indication of goodness of fit and the percentage of the response variable variation that is explained by a linear model.

The Random Forest Regressor outperformed other models with the lowest RMSE, indicating its effectiveness in handling the dataset's variability.
Linear Regression provided a quick but less accurate model.

Conclusion:
This project highlights the potential of machine learning techniques in predicting medical insurance costs with high accuracy. Key insights from the project include:

Performance: The ensemble models, particularly the Random Forest, proved highly effective
Importance of Features: Age, BMI, and smoking status were identified as significant predictors, aligning with expectations in medical cost analysis.

Future Directions:
Further Model Tuning: Tuning and experimentation with hyperparameters could further enhance model accuracy.
Incorporating More Features: Including more variables, such as geographical data and detailed medical history, could improve the modelâ€™s predictive power.
Deployment: The model can be deployed in a real-world scenario within a web application to provide real-time insurance cost predictions.
